3. **Security & Compliance**
   - JWT authentication with 15m access, 7d refresh tokens
   - RBAC with admin/user roles
   - Rate limiting (100 req/min per IP)
   - HMAC audit log integrity
   - Input validation and sanitization

4. **API Endpoints**
   - User: register, login, refresh, profile management
   - Payment: initiate, verify, status, transactions list
   - Audit: logs query, statistics (admin only)
   - Health checks for all services

## Implementation Priority Matrix

| Component | Business Value | Technical Complexity | Dependencies | Priority |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|----------|
| Digital Logbook | High | Medium | Payment Service | 1 |
| Pricing Service | High | Low | None | 1 |
| Reconciliation Engine | High | High | Logbook, Pricing | 1 |
| Notification Engine | Medium | Medium | Payment Service | 1 |
| Web Dashboard | High | Medium | All Backend Services | 2 |
| Docker Containers | Medium | Low | None | 2 |
| CI/CD Pipeline | Medium | Medium | Docker | 3 |
| Monitoring Stack | Medium | High | All Services | 3 |
| Multi-Provider | Low | High | Payment Service | 4 |
| Subscriptions | Low | High | Payment Service | 4 |

## Phase 3 Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Digital logbook entries can be created with photo/location
- [ ] Automatic reconciliation matches 90%+ of transactions
- [ ] SMS/Email notifications sent for payment events
- [ ] Web dashboard provides complete user experience
- [ ] Admin panel enables reconciliation management
- [ ] All services containerized and deployable

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] API response times < 200ms (95th percentile)
- [ ] System handles 1000+ concurrent users
- [ ] 99.9% uptime with proper monitoring
- [ ] All endpoints have comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Security audit passes with no critical issues

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] All new services follow Phase 2 architectural patterns
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Production-ready deployment configuration
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Reconciliation Algorithm Complexity**: Matching transactions to logbook entries
- **Offline Sync Conflicts**: Handling duplicate entries from mobile clients
- **Payment Provider Integration**: Multiple provider abstractions

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Under Load**: Database query optimization needed
- **Mobile Photo Upload**: Large file handling and storage
- **Notification Delivery**: SMS/Email provider reliability

### Low Risk
- **Frontend Development**: Standard React patterns
- **Docker Containerization**: Well-established practices
- **CI/CD Setup**: Standard GitHub Actions workflows

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Business Logic Layer** (Priority 1 components)
2. **Implement with continuous validation** (build + test after each component)
3. **Follow established patterns** from Phase 2 implementation
4. **Maintain security standards** throughout development
5. **Document everything** as implementation progresses

This analysis provides the foundation for systematic Phase 3 implementation with clear priorities, success criteria, and risk mitigation strategies.
